With Mark Fabian, Anna Alexandrova, Diane Coyle and Matthew Agarwala. Forthcoming at the *Journal of European Public Policy*

There is a rising tide of advocacy for public policy to be made on the basis of ‘subjective
wellbeing’. We argue that the vast majority of the associated policy proposals adopt the same
‘social planner perspective’ that undergirds conventional economic policy analysis. This
perspective is broadly technocratic, emphasising scientific standards for what constitutes good
policy and empowering ‘dispassionate’ experts. We argue that WPP could and should lend itself
to a more transformative agenda, one that embraces the value-laden nature of ‘wellbeing’ as a
concept. This would see WPP relinquish the social planner perspective’s arguably naïve ideal of
objective analysis by technical experts and instead give a greater role to participatory and
deliberative modes of policymaking to define, analyse, and measure wellbeing and ultimately
make policy decisions. We call this the ‘citizen perspective’.
