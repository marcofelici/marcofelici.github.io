**The heterogeneous relationship of education with wellbeing**, with Matthew Agarwala

We use the theory of subjective wellbeing (SWB) homeostasis, combined with
the properties of education as a positional good, to make predictions about the
distinct relationship between education and SWB across the distribution of
SWB. Theoretically, we propose that education acts as a buffer against negative
shocks to SWB, but in the absence of such shocks, might lead to some
individuals becoming frustrated achievers. Empirically, we conjecture that the
relationship between education and SWB should be large, positive, and
significant for those with low SWB, but that it should fall in significance and
magnitude for those with higher SWB. Using two different datasets on the
United Kingdom, we first test these hypotheses in the cross-section and then
characterise their longitudinal dynamics in an event study design. Our
predictions are confirmed in the cross-section and are consistent with the
longitudinal results. We further illustrate how the results follow a geographic
gradient.
