I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Cambridge, Department of Land Economy and Darwin College. My research spans household finance, housing, subjective well-being and mental health. I have worked as a Research Assistant at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at Cambridge, as a Teaching Associate at the Department of Land Economy at Cambridge, as a Research Analyst and Trainee at DG-Research of the European Central Bank and as a Research Intern at the Social Market Foundation. Before that, I have completed my Master's at the Barcelona School of Economics, my Bachelor's at Bocconi University and the International Baccalaureate Diploma at the United World College Red Cross Nordic. In 2015 I co-founded the Italian think-tank Tortuga. I also enjoy creative writing and I have written two interactive quests in Cambridge through the platform Questo and a novel (in Italian).
