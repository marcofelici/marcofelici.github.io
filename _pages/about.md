I am a Graduate Programme Participant at the European Central Bank (currently working on Securitisations at DG-HOL, previously on Distributional Wealth Accounts at DG-Statistics). I am also an Affiliated Researcher at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy (University of Cambridge). I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge (Department of Land Economy and Darwin College) in December 2022. My [research](https://marcofelici.github.io/research/) spans household finance, housing, subjective well-being and mental health. 

I have worked as a Statistician for Spark Wave, as a Research Assistant at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, as a Teaching Associate at the Department of Land Economy of the University of Cambridge, as a Rapporteur for Bruegel 5th Triennial Review, as a Research Analyst and Trainee at DG-Research of the European Central Bank and as a Research Intern at the Social Market Foundation and at IDEA 2020. Before that, I have completed my Master's at the Barcelona School of Economics, my Bachelor's at Bocconi University and the International Baccalaureate Diploma at the United World College Red Cross Nordic. 

In 2015 I co-founded the Italian think-tank [Tortuga](https://www.tortuga-econ.it/). I also enjoy creative writing and I have written two [interactive quests](https://questoapp.com/city-games/highlights-of-cambridge-scholars-and-secret-societies-city-walk) in Cambridge through the platform Questo and a [novel](https://www.amazon.it/Adamantino-Marco-Felici-ebook/dp/B0744D4CD8) (in Italian).
