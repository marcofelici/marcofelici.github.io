I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Cambridge, Department of Land Economy and Darwin College. My [research](https://marcofelici.github.io/research/) spans household finance, housing, subjective well-being and mental health. In September, I will join the European Central Bank as a Graduate Programme participant. 

I have worked as a Research Assistant at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at Cambridge, as a Teaching Associate at the Department of Land Economy at Cambridge, as a Research Analyst and Trainee at DG-Research of the European Central Bank and as a Research Intern at the Social Market Foundation and at IDEA 2020. Before that, I have completed my Master's at the Barcelona School of Economics, my Bachelor's at Bocconi University and the International Baccalaureate Diploma at the United World College Red Cross Nordic. 

In 2015 I co-founded the Italian think-tank [Tortuga](https://www.tortuga-econ.it/). I also enjoy creative writing and I have written two [interactive quests](https://questoapp.com/city-games/highlights-of-cambridge-scholars-and-secret-societies-city-walk) in Cambridge through the platform Questo and a [novel](https://www.amazon.it/Adamantino-Marco-Felici-ebook/dp/B0744D4CD8) (in Italian).
